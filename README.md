Hi whoever is reading this, hope everything is alright. This is a little project about creating a basic recipe website. Nothing too fancy, just a index page with a few links.
I think i can do it lmao, i hope so at least.

So far, I've learnt the basic layout of a webpage, for example the specific elements that must be included 
I also know how to create paragraphs; i just don't know how to make bigger gaps between those paragraphs but ill find out one day.
I know how to make text bold and how to make italics, its pretty nice.
I've also learnt how to make lists, but i really need to study more about it since i think i did it wrong. 
I also know how to make comments which dont display on a browser, i just dont think i need to make any comments yet.
Oh, i know how to add links with an anchor 

But yea im still learning, i hope this turns out somewhat well. 

Thanks for reading, if someone is actually reading this.
